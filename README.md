1. Launch virtual machine on cyverse
2. Navigate to /home/jovyan/data-store
3. git clone repo
4. install environment if planet environment is not currently activated
    - Launching Planet Jupyter Labs on cyverse automatically activates planet environment
      * update:* lies, to activate the environment paste
